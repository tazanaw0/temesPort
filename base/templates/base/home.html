                        <hr>
                        <p><p>Welcome!! My name is Temesgen Azanaw and I've always had a profound love for photography. My love for the art originated from my father, who would often take photos for my family and edit them as a hobby.</p>
                        <p>At a young age, my father didn't seem very supportive of the idea that I wanted to take photos as a hobby. Because of this, it took me quite a while to fully immerse myself in the craft (iPod/iPhone photography wasn't common in the early 2000s). Luckily, prior to moving into my first year of university, I was able to purchase a Canon DSLR that I was VERY EXCITED about. I remember watching many unboxing and how-to videos leading up to the day I was able to purchase my first camera.</p>
                        
                        <p>As soon as I purchased the camera, I wasted no time whatsoever! The first day, I was able to get Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, which encouraged me to go out and start taking photos! My first "photoshoot" occurred at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Keeping note of the various videos I watched, which discussed how to achieve bokeh, reduce exposure, ISO (light let into the camera), etc., I was well prepared for my first shoot!</p>
